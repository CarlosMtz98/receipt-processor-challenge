## Run webservice instructions

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for taking the time to test and evaluate my api implementation. 

This api service uses Docker which will take care to set up the environment and all dependencies.

## Getting Started
### Run server
To run the server locally run the following command
```bash
make local
```

#### Create new receipt
```bash
curl --location 'localhost:7070/receipts/process' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "retailer": "M&M Corner Market",
  "purchaseDate": "2023-10-08",
  "purchaseTime": "15:45",
  "items": [
    {
      "shortDescription": "Mountain Dew",
      "price": "1.85"
    },
    {
      "shortDescription": "Sour Patch Kids",
      "price": "4.21"
    },
    {
      "shortDescription": "Swedish Fish",
      "price": "1.50"
    },
    {
      "shortDescription": "Takis",
      "price": "2.30"
    }
  ],
  "total": "9.86"
}'
```
#### Get receipt points
```bash
curl --location 'localhost:7070/receipts/<receiptId>/points'
```

### Debug server
To debug the server run the following command
```bash
make run
```

### Run tests
This command will run all the available tests inside the project with the coverage they have
```bash
make tests
```

## Troubleshooting
If you got any problems using the make files you can manually execute them using the following commands

### Run server alternative
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

### Debug server alternative
```bash
go run ./cmd/main.go
```
